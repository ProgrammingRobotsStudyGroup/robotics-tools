oriented machine that can sense, plan, and act.  The purpose for this
repository is to collect information such as:
- the tools available in the [Robot Garden Workshop][rg-workshop-link]
- tips for learning to use and maintain the tools
- sources for acquiring other materials
- the tools / expertise available from the Robot Garden community

Arbitrary Categories
- [wiring](wiring.md) - wiring for connecting electrical components
- [electronics](electronics.md) - tools for powering electrical components
- [sensors](sensors.md) - tools for gathering information about the world
- [planners](planners.md) - microcontrollers and processors for planning and
  computation
- [general](general.md) - miscellaneous tools that are helpful

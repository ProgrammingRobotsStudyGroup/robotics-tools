# Robotics Tools and Materials

Robots don't materialize out of thin air, you need tools to build a goal
oriented machine that can sense, plan, and act.

The purpose for this repository is to collect information such as:
- the tools available in the [Robot Garden Workshop](http://www.robotgarden.org/workshop/#programs)
- the tools / expertise available from Robot Garden community members
- tips for using and maintaining tools
- sources for acquiring other materials

Categories
- [wiring](wiring.md) - wiring for connecting electrical components
- [electronics](electronics.md) - tools for powering electrical components
- [sensors](sensors.md) - tools for gathering information about the world
- [planners](planners.md) - microcontrollers and processors for planning and
  computation
- [general](general.md) - miscellaneous tools that are helpful

## SBU Classes at Robot Garden

[Robot Garden Soldering SBU](http://www.robotgarden.org/workshop/safety-and-basic-use/): Learn to assemble circuit boards with an iron and solder.  A soldering kit is required for this class. You can purchase one of our stock kits from our store or in person at the time of the class. If you have your own basic (through hole, not surface mount) soldering project, it’s also possible to bring that in but please seek instructor approval first.
